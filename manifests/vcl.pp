# == Class: varnish::vcl
nclude#
# to change name/location of vcl file, use $varnish_vcl_conf in the main varnish class
#
# NOTE: though you can pass config for backends, directors, acls, probes and selectors
#       as parameters to this class, it is recommended to use existing definitions instead:
#       varnish::backend
#       varnish::director
#       varnish::probe
#       varnish::acl
#       varnish::selector
#
# === Parameters
#
# probes     - list of probes to configure, must be a hash:
#    probes => {
#      'health_check1' => { url => '/health_check_url1' },
#      'health_check2' => {
#        window    => '8',
#        timeout   => '5s',
#        threshold => '3',
#        interval  => '5s',
#        request   => [ "GET /action/healthCheck1 HTTP/1.1", "Host: www.example1.com", "Connection: close" ]
#      }
#    }
#    NOTE: available probes are defined by array $probe_params in varnish::probe definition
#          $probe_params = [ 'interval', 'timeout', 'threshold', 'window', 'url', 'request' ]
#
#
# backends   - list of backends to configure, must be a hash
#    backends => {
#      'srv1' => { host => '172.16.0.1', port => '80', probe => 'health_check1' },
#      'srv2' => { host => '172.16.0.2', port => '80', probe => 'health_check1' },
#      'srv3' => { host => '172.16.0.3', port => '80', probe => 'health_check2' },
#      'srv4' => { host => '172.16.0.4', port => '80', probe => 'health_check2' },
#      'srv5' => { host => '172.16.0.5', port => '80', probe => 'health_check2' },
#      'srv6' => { host => '172.16.0.6', port => '80', probe => 'health_check2' }
#    }
#
#
# directors  - list of directors to configure, must be a hash
#              you can also provide $type which by default is set to 'round-robin'
#    directors => {
#      'cluster1' => { backends => [ 'srv1', 'srv2' ] },
#      'cluster2' => { backends => [ 'srv3', 'srv4', 'srv5', 'srv6' ] }
#    }
#
#
# acls       - list of acls to configure, must be a hash
#              NOTE: acl names 'blockedips' and 'purge' are reserved
#                    and cannot be set by this parameter.
#                    They exist as separate parameters for this class (see below)
#              TODO: need to work out how to pass ! to acl, i.e.
#                    acl blah {
#                      "172.16.1.0"/24;
#                      ! "172.16.1.1";
#                    }
#    acls => {
#      'acl1' => { hosts => [ "localhost", "172.16.0.1" ] },
#      'acl2' => { hosts => [ "localhost", "192.168.0.0/24" ] }
#    }
#
#
# selectors  - list of selectors, configured only when multiple backends/directors are in use
#              will be configured in the same order as listed in manifest. Must be a Hash
#    selectors => {
#      'cluster1' => { condition => 'req.url ~ "^/cluster1"' },
#      'cluster2' => { condition => 'true' } # will act as backend set by else statement
#    }
#
#
# conditions - list of conditions to apply, must be an array of hashes
#
# template   - you can build your own template and pass it to thei class with option template
#              please make sure your template uses same vars and datatypes as original one
#
#
# NOTE: VCL applies following restictions:
# - if you define an acl it must be used
# - if you define a probe it must be used
# - if you define a backend it must be used
# - if you define a director it must be used
#
# You cannot define 2 or more backends/directors and not to have selectors
# Not following above rules will result in VCL compilation failure
#
#
# === Examples
#
# subdir tests has a number of examples on using either varnish::vsl class,
# as well as varnish::backend, varnish::director, etc. definitions
#
